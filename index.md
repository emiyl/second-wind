Second Wind is a large-scale mod which looks to expand The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It adds new content to the game, similar to a DLC pack, and provides various overhauls, bug fixes, tweaks and new gameplay elements for players to explore.

You can install this mod on either a homebrewed Wii U or Nintendo Switch. Alternatively, you can also install it on a Windows PC using Cemu, a Wii U emulator. This guide will take you through the necessary steps to prepare your console or PC for modding.
