[Second Wind](https://gamebanana.com/projects/35468) is a large-scale mod which looks to expand The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It adds new content to the game, similar to a DLC pack, and provides various overhauls, bug fixes, tweaks and new gameplay elements for players to explore. For more info, check out the [wiki](https://secondwind.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Wind_Wiki).

You can install this mod either on a homebrewed Wii U or on a Windows PC using Cemu, a Wii U emulator. This guide will take you through the necessary steps to prepare your console or PC for modding.
